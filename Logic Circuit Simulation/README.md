# Logic-Circuit-Simulator

This is a logic circuit simulator that requires a .cir, .stim, .lib files and will write the output in the provided .sim file. The order your inputs in the .cir file is how they are assigned to the expression in the program, and the names of the inputs in the .stim files and .cir file are matching i.e. if you want to provide an input for A it should be labeled that way in the .cir. 

The files the are needed to run this on your device are in the source files and header files folders along with the CMakeLists.txt. 

Once you run the program you will interact with it through the terminal. Provide the .lib file then .cir then .stim then .sim as you are prompted from the terminal.Then the final output will be shown in the format of Time - Input/Output.
